					<h2 class= "heading">San Francisco, CA</h2>
						<p id= "para"> I visited San Francisco for the first time in Februaruy 2013 and fell in love with the city instantly. The important places to see in SFO include the Golden gate bridge,one of the modern wonders of the world.
							 It was opened in 1937 and at that time it was the longest suspension bridge ever created. Also the waterfront at Fisherman’s Wharf is another must see place in SFO. Here you can experience some fantastic food and enjoy some of the best dining the world has to offer.</p>

					<h2 class= "heading">Pella, IA</h2>
						<p id= "para">I visited Pella, IA in May 2013. Pella offers a "touch of Holland" right here in Iowa. Best known for its annual "Tulip Time" celebration, Pella is covered in these cheerful spring flowers during the first week in May.
						Pella is beautiful and unique all year long, but at Tulip Time it comes alive with tulips, Dutch attire, food, fun, and more. Thousands of residents wear Dutch attire and celebrate our Dutch heritage. Three days each spring, Pella becomes the Netherlands to Pella residents and visitors alike. Travel back in time with us to a European village full of tulips and excitement.</p>

					<h2 class= "heading">Chicago, IL</h2>
						<p id= "para">I visited Chicago for the first time in August , 2013 and since then I have visited the windy city numerous times. And every time , the city has something new to amuse me. The city is famous for its deep-dish pizza, ballparks, beer, comedy clubs, world-class museums, and blues.Chicago is undoubtedly one of the best culinary destinations in the country, and one of just a handful of cities in the United States with a dedicated Michelin guide, honoring the best fine dining the city has to offer.
							Some of the must see places in Chicago include the sky deck, millenium park, Shedd's Aquarium, navy pier, Planeterium and most importantly 360 Chicago.</p>

					<h2 class= "heading">New York, NY</h2>

The important places that we visited during our trip to NYC are the Empire state building, times square, wax museum, central park, brookyln bridge, 9/11 memorial and of course the statue of liberty. The annual Macy's fireworks show is one spectacular event that you shouldn't miss if you are visiting the bigapple in July. </p>

					<a name="niagara"></a>
					<h2 class= "heading">Niagara, NY</h2>
						<p id= "para">The splendid main attraction - more than six million feet of water cascading over a rocky crest - sits partially in the United States and partially in Canada. The U.S. side has recently been busy promoting other activities to lure visitors. Venues like the Aquarium of Niagara offer parents fun and engaging alternatives for kids, after or in between visits to the Falls. Outdoor recreation such as hiking, biking, fishing and camping can be found at the Niagara Falls State Park. The storied history of attempts to conquer the majestic Falls is captured at the Daredevil Museum; the Schoellkopf Museum concentrates on the history and geology. There's more to the Falls than, well, the Falls, including a wide array of dining and lodging options, from budget to upscale. This awe-inspiring region makes for an exhilarating and multi-faceted getaway.</p>

					<h2 class= "heading">Gatlinburg, TN</h2>
						<p id= "para"> Gatlinburg, a mountain town in eastern Tennessee, is known as a gateway to the roughly 520,000-acre Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Many of its key attractions offer sweeping views of the neighboring park, including the 407-ft.
